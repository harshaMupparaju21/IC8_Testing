# IC8_Testing

The problem is to find the maximun number of urinals that are free to use in a men's bathroom provided that no two consecutive urinals are used. A vacant urinal is represented by 0 and an occupied urinal is represented by 1. The set of urinals are represented by string of 1's and 0's. This string is invalid if it contains any character other than 0 and 1. Also the string is invalid if more than two consecutive 1's occur (-1 is returned in such case). In such a scenario,the expectation is to find number of urinals that can be used.


1. Created Urinals.java and UrinalsTest.java for development.
2. Urinals.dat file conatins the input list of urinals sets in string format.
3. rule.txt contains the output.


Run main method in UrinalsTest.java to run all test cases and for creating a new output file.
